### User-Story

```md
AS a patient who has tried all conventional treatments for my health issues
I am looking for alternative treatments that are safe and free of side effects
SO I can better manage my health (and maybe have a laugh while at it).
```

### Elevator-Pitch

We all know someone who has consulted multiple health modalities for their health concerns, but never had satisfactory results. We at Innovate Rx pride ourselves for being the first of our kind of health care providers who provide what we call 'humerus' therapy, named after the anatomical term for the 'tickle bone'.

Side effects include; none! That's right, 'humerus' therapy has not been proven to cause any side effects other than mild laugh attacks and side stitches. We are covered under all insurance plans, and will work with you to ensure your comfort and compliance.

### Application-Description

This application simulates an Online Medical Visit Simulator for a small medical practice. In this case, the application serves as a website for a non-traditional (read 'Innovative'!) treatment practice where the doctors specialize in their own brand of innovative treatments.

### Features

Our web application works with the following steps:

- Sign-Up and Log-In for patients
- Hashed password storage for security
- Request an appointment
- Choose a doctor from a list
- Accept the prescribed tests
- Look up test results
- Doctor logs in to review test results and preliminary diagnosis
- Doctor prescribes treatment (based on their character and personality)
- Look up your prescribed treatments

### Development-Team

    Tony Tran - Project manager and back end development,
    Fahad Hai - Front end development,
    Greg Nguenang - Back end and database development

### Technologies-Used

MVC Model
Front end uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript
Back end development uses Node, NPM, ExpressJS, MySQL, Sequelize
Hosting is done through Heroku.com

### Usage

Visit our deployed website on Heroku at <a href="https://innovate-rx.herokuapp.com/">Heroku live link</a>.

### License

This application is hosted under the MIT license.

### Future-Development

We aim to add the following features for the app in the future:

- Build a larger database with more doctors, tests and treatment responses
- Hosting relevant and similarly themed articles in a new 'readables' resource section
- Give feedback on the treatment
- Request new treatment
- Give feedback on the doctors and treatments
- Use a private messageboard-style chat to communicate directly with your doctors
